[SCP-427]
image1=427.jpg
text1=SCP-427 is a small, spherical, ornately carved locket made of a polished silver material. The ornate carvings do not seem to serve any function.
text2=SCP-427 was created after placing a pill of SCP-500 in the Input booth of SCP-914 and using the Fine setting. It displays no unusual activity when closed. When SCP-427 is opened and exposed to biological tissue, it rapidly regenerates cellular damage and somehow is able to purge invading compounds or infections.
text3=However, long-term exposure produces a significant health hazard. As the locket heals damage, it optimizes the body's natural systems. Class-D personnel exposed to the device for over an hour total began mutating into a shapeless mass of tissue.
text4=The "Flesh Beasts" created by SCP-427 are incredibly aggressive, attacking any and all personnel on sight with lethal results. They are highly resistant to most known weaponry.

[SCP-457]
image1=457.jpg
text1=For all points and purposes, SCP-457 appears to be a sentient being composed of flame. SCP-457's actual composition is unknown, and has proven to be invisible and undetectable by any known means, but is shaped out by the flames it produces, often assuming a human-like form if given sufficient fuel to assume that size.
text2=SCP-457's most rudimentary form appears to be that of a single flame, comparable in size to that of a matchstick. In this form, SCP-457 possesses only the simplest of directives and shows no signs of being unusual compared to any other flame beyond a penchant for suddenly flickering to burn human hands, and the ability to 'jump' to more flammable materials or other flames, which it then assimilates into its total form.
text3=As SCP-457 grows larger, it is able to assume more complex shapes, and its intelligence grows with size and fuel sources. SCP-457's method of intelligence is unknown, but upon reaching an approximately human size, SCP-457 almost always assumes a human-like form surrounded by and composed of flames.

[SCP-1048]
image1=1048.jpg
text1=SCP-1048 is a small teddy bear, approximately 33 cm in height. Through testing, composition of the subject revealed no unusual qualities that make it discernible from a non-sapient teddy bear.
text2=Subject is capable of moving of its own accord, and can communicate through a small range of gestures. The subject regularly shows affection to individuals in ways found endearing by most people.
text3=It is hypothesized that the subject is able to construct crude replicas of itself using various materials, by a process that has yet to be observed directly by Foundation staff.
text4=The whereabouts of SCP-1048 are currently unknown.

[SCP-1048-A]
image1=1048a.jpg
text1=On __/__/____, SCP-1048-A was discovered wandering Site 24. Subject resembles a teddy bear similar in size and shape to SCP-1048, but is made entirely out of human ears.
text2=Upon confrontation, SCP-1048-A will emit a high pitched shriek inflicting intense pain in the eyes and ears of everyone in a 10 meter radius.
text3=Immediately upon perceiving the shriek emitted by SCP-1048-A, affected subjects begin developing ear-like growths on their entire bodies, quickly leading to death by asphyxiation.

[SCP-1123]
