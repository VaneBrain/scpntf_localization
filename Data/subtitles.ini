[line_0_1_player]
text=No turning back now. Let's do this.

[line_1_1_regular]
text=This place seriously gives me the creeps... Let's get this over with quickly.

[line_2_1_medic]
text=I wonder what will happen after this, man.
[line_2_2_regular]
text=I don't know. Let's just get this over with.
[line_2_3_medic]
text=[Sigh] Okay.

[line_3_1_medic]
text=Looks like nobody is around.
[line_3_2_regular]
text=It's quiet... Too quiet. My gut tells me something isn't right.
[line_3_3_medic]
text=Heh, either that or it's whatever you ate at the morning.

[line_4_1_medic]
text=Hey, isn't it Wednesday today? Oh! That means pizza day, right?!
[line_4_2_regular]
text=I don't know. Even if it was, doubt there'd be any left for us.

[line_5_1_medic]
text=Uh... Did you see that?
[line_5_2_regular]
text=Huh?
[line_5_3_medic]
text=Huh, I thought I saw something zip by... Nevermind. I guess my mask is kinda fogging up.

[line_20_1_medic]
text=Check and mate.
[line_20_2_regular]
text=How could you tell? I thought you didn't know how to play this.

[line_21_1_medic]
text=Oh! Looks like a smoking booth. Didn't know they have this... Hey, did anyone bring a lighter?
[line_21_2_regular]
text=Smoking on the job ain't gonna' make it go any faster. So let's just get this over with.
[line_21_3_medic]
text=Yeah, you... You're probably right.

[line_100_1_player]
text=[Sigh] They must've cut the power, the elevator isn't working...
[line_100_2_medic]
text=It's probably part of the lockdown protocol. There should be a maintenance room nearby.
[line_100_3_player]
text=I'll go there and see what's wrong. You two, stay here and guard the elevators while I'm gone. In the case that we get greeted by "guests" or otherwise.

[line_101_1_regular]
text=Why are we using the elevator during a containment breach? Stairs are the safest alternative right now.
[line_101_2_medic]
text=What, scared the elevator will fall? [Laughing, then sigh] Besides, this place goes way too deep. My feet would be killing me more than anything else in this whole damn facility.
